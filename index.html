     <p>Hello, my name is Nasser Hameeda and I am 19 years old.
     Currently, I am a student at the British University of Bahrain.
     My hobbies include reading, gaming, watching various TV shows, and movies.</p>
     <p>I have created this website as a personal blog to share my favorite country that I have visited which is Turkey.
     I'm going to share my favorite parts of the trip, the different food, culture, and beautiful scenery I have experienced whilst visitng.</p>
     <p>Fun fact, I have visited Turkey twice and have went to Istanbul, and Boursa which are two big cities that are very different from each other.
      Istanbul, is a more modernized area of Turkey. However, Boursa is filled with natural scenery and ancient areas.</p>
